# Hello-World
A repository I have created in an attempt to learn to understand repositories.

From the moment I got my first computer I wanted to learn more about programming.
Because I never really had the time it took me a little while to really get started.
You are now a witness of my very first steps in creating a repository.
Enjoy!!
